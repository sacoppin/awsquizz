**Cost Allocation Tags**: You can tag resources. You can use AWS Cloud Explorer to view the cost of those tags.

A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. You can use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level. After you activate cost allocation tags, AWS uses the cost allocation tags to organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs. AWS provides two types of cost allocation tags, an AWS generated tags and user-defined tags. AWS, or AWS Marketplace ISV defines, creates, and applies the AWS generated tags for you, and you define, create, and apply user-defined tags. You must activate both types of tags separately before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report.

Dedicated EC2 Server integrated with AWS License Manager

Bring existing licenses to Dedicated Hosts

Amazon EC2 offers Dedicated Hosts, which allow you to access hardware that's fully dedicated for your use. You can use your own licensed software on dedicated infrastructure, even without Software Assurance. For more information on bringing licenses without Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits, please visit this section of the FAQ.

Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is also integrated with AWS License Manager, a service which helps you manage your software licenses, including Windows Server and SQL Server licenses. In License Manager, you can specify your licensing terms for governing license usage, and easily track licenses for compliance and auditing. You can also specify Dedicated Host management preferences for host allocation and host capacity utilization. Once setup, AWS takes care of these administrative tasks on your behalf, so that you can seamlessly launch virtual machines (instances) on Dedicated Hosts just like you would launch an EC2 instance with AWS-provided licenses.

Eligible Products

Microsoft software covered by the Microsoft Product Terms can be deployed on AWS using Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts. Examples include:

Microsoft Windows Server
Microsoft SQL Server
Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (user CALs)
