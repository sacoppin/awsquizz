#### There is a requirement to host a set of servers in the Cloud for a short period of 3 months. Which of the following launch types for AWS EC2 instances should be chosen to be the most cost-effective?
- Spot Instances : Incorrect. Spot instances are cheap, but they are only for Applications that have flexible start and end times, Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices, or Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

- Partial Upfront costs Reserved : Incorrect. AWS requires a minimum 1-year term on their contracts for reserved instances.

- ##### On-Demand : Since the requirement is just for 3 months, then the most cost-effective option is to use On-Demand Instances.

- No Upfront costs Reserved : Incorrect. AWS requires a minimum 1-year term, and a successful billing history is needed before you can purchase No Upfront Reserved Instances.


#### In order to predict the cost of moving resources from on-premise to the cloud, which of the following can be used?

- AWS WAF

- AWS Pricing Calculator

- AWS Inspector

- AWS Trusted Advisor

The AWS TCO calculator makes it easy to estimate your savings when comparing the cloud to an on-premises or colocation environment. Use the TCO calculator to get detailed reports and insights into the cost components that make AWS a viable alternative to lower your costs.

#### Which of the following storage mechanisms can be used to store messages effectively which can be used across distributed systems.

- Amazon EBS Snapshots

- Amazon SQS

- Amazon Glacier

- Amazon EBS Volumes

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. It moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.

#### Which of the following security features is associated with a Subnet in a VPC to protect against Incoming traffic requests.

- NACL

- Subnet Groups

- AWS Inspector

- Security Groups


EXPLANATION
A-network access control list (ACL)-is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

#### What service from AWS can help manage the costs for all resources in AWS?

- AWS Consolidated Billing is for managing the billing from multiple AWS accounts.

- Payment history just allows you to view your previous payments made to AWS.

- A Cost Allocation tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource to help track AWS costs.

- Cost Explorer is a free tool that you can use to view your costs. You can view your costs as either a cash-based view (costs are recorded when cash is received or paid) with unblended costs or as an accrual-based view (costs are recorded when income is earned or costs are incurred). You can view data for up to the last 12 months, forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next three months, and get recommendations for what Reserved Instances to purchase.

#### Which of the following options of AWS RDS allows for AWS to failover to a secondary database in case the primary one fails?

- AWS Failover

- AWS Standby

- AWS Secondary

- AWS Multi-AZ.

Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

#### What AWS service has built-in DDoS mitigation?

- CloudTrail

- EC2

- CloudFront

- CloudWatch


EXPLANATION
CloudFront also integrates with-AWS WAF, a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits, and-AWS Shield, a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards web applications running on AW



#### A company wants to run a development environment for their web application which is backed by the relational database Postgres.
#### Which AWS service would best meet their requirements?

- Amazon Aurora

You can use Amazon Aurora but it's expensive and intended for production workloads.

- AWS Postgres
There is no such service name AWS Postgres


- DynamoDB is a NoSQL database

- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) supports Postgres engines and is suited for both development and production workloads.

It works well for development workloads since you can choose a free-tier instance type and choose to opt-out of costly features like Multi-AZ

#### An AWS Availability Zone (AZ) is a single point of failure. To avoid a single point of failure, a company needs to deploy its workload across multiple AZs in the same AWS Region.

TRUE

FALSE

An Availability Zone (AZ) is not a single point of failure.

An AZ can be composed of multiple data centers at a single location (separate building per data center) Within a data center, hardware is physically isolated from each other in the case of a disaster. So, for example, if one room catches fire, the other rooms will not be affected.

#### In order to use CloudWatch Alarms to monitor Billing information, what two things must you do?

* *Create a Billing Alarm*

- Create an AWS Budget.
AWS Budget likely uses Billing Alarms underneath but they are managed by AWS. The question is about using a Billing Alarm directly.

- Enable Cost and Usage Reports.
Cost and Usage Reports does not relate to Billing Alarms

* *Enable Billing Alerts*.

(Before you can create an alarm for your estimated charges, you must enable billing alerts, so that you can monitor your estimated AWS charges and create an alarm using billing metric data. After you enable billing alerts, you can't disable data collection, but you can delete any billing alarms that you created.

After you enable billing alerts for the first time, it takes about 15 minutes before you can view billing data and set billing alarms.)

- Create an AWS Cost and Usage Report

(Cost and Usage Reports does not relate to Billing Alarms)

You can monitor your estimated AWS charges by using Amazon CloudWatch. When you enable the monitoring of estimated charges for your AWS account, the estimated charges are calculated and sent several times daily to CloudWatch as metric data.

Billing metric data is stored in the US East (N. Virginia) Region and represents worldwide charges. This data includes the estimated charges for every service in AWS that you use, in addition to the estimated overall total of your AWS charges.

The alarm triggers when your account billing exceeds the threshold you specify. It triggers only when actual billing exceeds the threshold. It doesn't use projections based on your usage so far in the month.

If you create a billing alarm at a time when your charges have already exceeded the threshold, the alarm goes to the ALARM state immediately.

#### An organization wants to download a compliance report to attest that AWS meets regulatory compliance before they decide to adopt AWS as their primary cloud service provider.
